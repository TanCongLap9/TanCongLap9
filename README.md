### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**TanCongLap9/TanCongLap9** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on no one yet.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing yet.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coding.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: By name, by other social media.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also like programming in language other than JS.

The introduction ends. Back to working on projects...
